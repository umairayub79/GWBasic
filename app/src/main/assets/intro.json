    "intro":"GW-BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed by Microsoft from BASICA, originally for Compaq. \n It is otherwise identical to Microsoft/IBM BASICA, but is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the ROM BASIC.\n\nIt was bundled with MS-DOS operating systems on IBM PC compatibles by Microsoft. Microsoft also sold a BASIC compiler, BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed.\nThe language is suitable for simple games, business programs and the like. Since it was included with most versions of MS-DOS, it was also a low-cost way for many aspiring programmers to learn the fundamentals of computer programming.\n\nGW-BASIC has a command line-based integrated development environment (IDE) based on Dartmouth BASIC.Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on screen can be edited. \nIt also includes function key shortcuts at the bottom of the screen.Like other early microcomputer versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacked many of the structures needed for structured programming such as local variables,\n\nGW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly, because it was an interpreted programming language.All program lines must be numbered;\n all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in direct mode to be executed immediately.Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with tokens replacing commands,\n with an option to save in ASCII text form.The GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to RUN, LOAD, SAVE, LIST the current program,\nor quit to the operating SYSTEM; these commands can also be used as program statements.\n\n There is little support for structured programming in GW-BASIC.All IF/THEN/ELSE conditional statements must be written on one line although WHILE/WEND statements may group multiple lines."
